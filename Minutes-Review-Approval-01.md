DRAFT Process for Reviewing and Posting Official Meeting Minutes 
 
1. Draft minutes will be made available for review and comment by the Board.
  - Redline/comments will be made using the in-document change suggestion option.
  - Reviews are open for one week from the posting date, although significant changes/issues may extend the review period in rare cases.
  - Once the review window has ended, a note will be sent to the Board notifying that the review period has closed.
  - Minutes shall be approved within two weeks of a board meeting.

2. A note will be sent to the Chair asking for approval to release (it will be the Chairâ€™s responsibility to assess if consensus has been reached).

3. IETF Secretariat will post the minutes to the IETF LLC website as soon as possible after they have been approved by the board.
